# Freelancer: HD Edition
Freelancer: HD Edition is a mod that aims to improve every visual, aural, and gameplay aspect of the game Freelancer (2003) while keeping the look and feel as close to vanilla as possible. It also serves as an all-in-one package for players so they don't have to worry about installing countless patches and mods to create the perfect HD and bug-free install.

**N.B. This mod does not add additional content op top of Freelancer but rather enhances what the game already has to offer. Although minor gameplay changes were made, Freelancer: HD Edition will always be compatible with vanilla Freelancer. Therefore, players can use this mod to play on all vanilla servers as long as the server owners allow these changes.**

If you have selected the Windows 10 compatibility patch when installing this mod, you can learn how to enable native anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering here: [How to enable native MSAA and Anisotropic Filtering with the Windows 10 compatibility patch](https://github.com/BC46/freelancer-hd-edition/wiki/How-to-enable-native-MSAA-and-Anisotropic-Filtering-with-the-Windows-10-compatibility-patch)

Due to the large file size of many textures used in this mod, some users may experience significantly longer load times during gameplay. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to install Freelancer: HD Edition on an (M.2) SSD.
