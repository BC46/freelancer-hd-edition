Territory allows customization of the message displayed when entering a system,
and the Houses on the Nav Map.	To use it, copy TERRITORY.DLL to the EXE
directory and add it to the [Libraries] section of EXE\dacom.ini.  Then copy
TERRITORY.INI to the DATA\UNIVERSE directory and edit it as required.  Please
read the start of TERRITORY.CPP for the description of its format.
