2. Features
</u></font></h2>
<p>
dgVoodoo 2 is a wrapper for old graphics API's for Windows Vista/7/8/10.
<br><br>
This wrapper can use Direct3D 11 with different device types as wrapping output:
<ul>
    <li>Hardware rendering at GPU feature level 10.1 (recommended)</li>
    <li>Hardware rendering at GPU feature level 10.0 (there are some restrictions)</li>
    <li>Software rendering through Microsoft WARP renderer</li>
</ul>

The API's it currently can wrap are:
<ul>
    <li>Glide 2.11, Glide 2.45, Glide 3.1 and Glide 3.1 Napalm</li>
    <li>DirectX 1-7 (all versions of DirectDraw and Direct3D up to version 7)</li>
    <li>Direct3D 8.1</li>
</ul>
<p>
For both Glide and DirectX, dgVoodoo pushes as many emulation work to the GPU as
possbile. Thus, the entire internal 3Dfx GPU logic is mapped to pixel shaders
for Glide emulation, and all the fixed function vertex & pixel processing
pipeline is implemented by shaders for DirectX emulation (when possible).<br>
dgVoodoo basically can work in two ways:
<ul>
    <li>Using its precompiled shaders - it is the less efficient mode (legacy) and doesn't provide DX8-level vertex/pixel pipeline functionality</li>
    <li>Using an external HLSL shader compiler - this is the most efficient and recommended mode and referred as 'dynamic shader compiling'</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If dynamic shader compiling is available (see Usage) then dgVoodoo can work
with specialized shaders requiring much less GPU power, providing much better
performance, especially on weaker video cards.<br>
</p>

<br>
<h2><font color = "#FFFFFF"><u>
3. Requirements
</u></font></h2>
<ul>
<li>Operating system:       Windows Vista/7/8/10</li>
<li>Hardware:               GPU supporting DirectX feature level 10.0.</li>
</ul>
Optional and recommended:
<ul>
    <li>GPU supporting DirectX <font color = "#FFFFFF">feature level 10.1</font></li>
    <li>HLSL shader compiler <font color = "#FFFFFF">(D3DCompiler_43 or D3DCompiler_47)</font><br>(note that D3DCompiler_47 is part of Windows 10)</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2><font color = "#FFFFFF"><u>
4. Test results
</u></font></h2>
<p>
We can examine this in two aspects:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Used hardware and performance</b></font><br>
        I've tested and run different versions of dgVoodoo2 on the following GPU's:
        <font color = "#FFFFFF"><ul>
            <li>Intel HD 2000 (feature level 10.0 only)</li>
            <li>GeForce 8600 GT (feature level 10.0 only)</li>
            <li>Intel HD 4000</li>
            <li>Geforce GT 610</li>
            <li>AMD HD 6450</li>
            <li>Intel HD Graphics 530</li>
            <li>GeForce GTS 450</li>
            <li>AMD HD 7850</li>
            <li>GeForce GTX Ti560 (RIP)</li>
            <li>AMD R7 360</li>
            <li>GeForce GTX 1060</li>
        </ul></font>
        If dynamic shader compiling is utilized then dgVoodoo generally performs quite well on all hardware except
        integrated chips (like Intel HD 2000 and 4000).<br>
        Using only precompiled shaders requires a mid-class video card at least, and the low-end ones (intended for office-like usage) like
        Geforce GT 610 and AMD HD 6450 are not recommended.
    </li>

    <br><li><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Accuracy of the emulation, individual games and applications</b></font><br>
        Of course it's not perfect but I think I got very nice results in general. I maintain expanding lists for games and demos, for DirectX emulation:<br>
        <a href="http://dege.fw.hu/Gallery/DXGamesGallery.html">Games</a><br>
        <a href="http://dege.fw.hu/Gallery/DXDemosGallery.html">Demos</a><br>
        </li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2><font color = "#FFFFFF"><u>
5. Usage
</u></font></h2>
<p>
There is no installer for dgVoodoo beacuse you can copy its dlls anywhere
you want (to use). If u like it and want to use as the only global Glide
wrapper on your machine then copy Glide dlls to the system folder.
For DirectX emulation only a local installation is possible since the
DirectX dlls CANNOT be copied to the system folder (see DirectX readme).
</p>
<p>
A Glide wrapped application can start up either in windowed or full screen
mode (it is controlled by the <font color = "#FFFFFF">Control Panel</font>, see later). Also, you can switch between
them during the gameplay by Alt-Enter. See 'Known issues' for more.
</p>
<p>
The same is true for wrapped DirectX applications, but it is a more
complicated case, see DirectX readme.
</p>
<p>
Glide and DirectX dlls can co-work inside a process so the same versions
of them have to be used within a folder. If one of them detects the other
with different version then it refuses to initialize and work.
Co-work is useful for applications that use DirectDraw for some initial
in-game menu and Glide for 3D rendering.
</p>
<p>
If you use dgVoodoo on Windows 10 then dynamic shader compiling is automatically
available because D3DCompiler_47 is part of the operating system.<br>
For preceding Windows versions (Vista, 7, 8) you need to download it manually and
then, you can copy this dll into each game folder next to the wrapper dlls but the
best practice is to copy it into
</p>

<ul>
<li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Windows\System32    folder for 32 bit operating systems</font></li>
<li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Windows\SysWOW64    folder for 64 bit operating systems</font></li>
</ul>

<p>
if it is not already there by the result of the installation of some
other software.<br>
Note that dgVoodoo supports both D3DCompiler_43 and D3DCompiler_47.
_43 is supported only because of compatibility with users having it
downloaded and copied into their system folder previously.
</p>
<p>
Utilizing dynamic shader compiling is strongly recommended and
even unavoidable to get all DX8 level features to work.
If dgVoodoo cannot find D3DCompiler then it can use only its
generalized precompiled shaders just like versions before 2.5.
If dgVoodoo finds a supported compiler dll then it can adapt to the current
circumstances and compile specialized shaders providing maximum GPU
performance.
</p>

<br>
<h2><font color = "#FFFFFF"><u>
6. Configuring
</u></font></h2>
<p>
As different options might wanted to be used for particular applications,
I kept the concept of local/global configurations (might be familiar from old dgVoodoo).
The configuration data is not stored in the dlls themself anymore.
It is in a separate file named 'dgVoodoo.conf'. All of the Glide and DirectX
dlls uses this file.
</p>
<p>
When the Glide or DirectX wrapped application starts, dgVoodoo tries to read
config data. The search paths and the order for the config file are the following:
<ul>
    <li>Folder of the wrapper DLL</li>
    <li>Folder of the application (EXE)</li>
    <li>User application data folder</li>
</ul>
If the config file can be found in none of them then the default config is used.
</p>
<p>
For modifying config files, you have <font color = "#FFFFFF">dgVoodoo Control Panel (dgVoodooCpl)</font>.
In dgVoodooCpl you can choose a folder where you can load (from) and save the current
configuration. After you chose a folder, it remains in the list permanently.
If the CPL application finds a valid config file in its own folder (where the app itself
is located) then it automatically places the folder into the list and selects the folder.
Otherwise the user's application data folder is selected, by default.
</p>
<p>
If an application tolerates losing focus without closing/minimizing itself,
you can configure it dynamically: when the CPL starts up it builds
a list of detected running Glide/DirectX wrapped applications and insert it
into the folder selector combobox. When you select such a running instance
then the current state of the application is read as config and most of the
options can also be changed. So, you can set resolution, msaa, brightness,
etc on the spot without restarting the application (configurable items depend
on emulation type). When an option changes, it takes effect at once. If the
dialog gets cancelled or an other config folder/instance is selected, all the
changes gets cancelled as well.
</p>
<p>
You can always use the <font color = "#FFFFFF">'Apply' button</font> to save the current config to the
selected folder or running application without exiting the CPL application.

Important to note:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
   If the wrapped app and the CPL runs on different privilege levels
   (admin/nonadmin) then the app won't appear in the instance list or they
   cannot communicate to each other. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
</li>
<li><p>
   Switching resolution or MSAA can only be performed perfectly if the
   application re-renders everything on each frame. If it uses or keeps
   previously (once-)rendered things like cockpits or similars then they will
   be missing as will not get re-rendered. (Glide only)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A folder inserted formerly into the list can be removed. Also, list of the
running instances can be refreshed.</p>

<p>
(Why configuration is still needed at all? Well, now it's not for choosing from
millions of technical options due to weak implementation but for fancy things,
see chapter 'General Control Panel (CPL) options' as well as Glide and DirectX readme.)
</p>

<br>
<h2><font color = "#FFFFFF"><u>
7. Resolution and refresh rate overriding
</u></font></h2>

<p>
You can override the application resolution and refresh rate both for
Glide and DirectX rendering.<br>
There are three types of resolution overriding, and, the 'Resolution'
comboboxes contain two types of elements in the enumerated list:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  <font color = "#FFFFFF">Static resolutions</font>
  <p>
  Those are enumerated by your videocard for the selected display output.
  Select any of them, and the wrapper will force that one (along with the selected refresh rate),
  no matter what resolution the application wants to set.<br>
  Resolution 'Unforced' means always using the current application resolution, so there is no overriding at all.
  </p>
</li>
<br>
<li>
  <font color = "#FFFFFF">Dynamic resolutions</font>
  <p>
  First, a little explanation on what the practical problems are with static
  resolutions (especially for DirectX applications).
  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>
    The application may use multiple resolutions for different parts like movies,
    menus and ingame. The statically chosen resolution may not have the same
    aspect ratio as those of them. For app-resolutions with different aspect
    ratios like 4:3 vs 16:9 it's a problem because one of them will be displayed
    hugely distorted.</p>

<li><p>
    Even if the app uses only one resolution, and you can select or type another
    one with the same aspect ratio, then selecting the proper resolution is still
    not an easy task:<br>
    a) you don't necessarily know what resolution the app uses<br>
    b) you don't necessarily know what the max resolution your display is capable
       of<br>
    c) even if you know both of them, you may have to calculate manually the
       desired resolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  (My own problem was the following: I sat down in front of a new computer with
   a 4K monitor and wanted to try out some stuffs through dgVoodoo. I faced the
   fact that I didn't know the exact monitor resolution, I also didn't know what
   res the stuffs to try were using. I just wanted the maximum available
   resolution to be forced that keeps the aspect ratio.)
</p>
<p>
  Dynamic resolution is the synonim of "let the wrapper choose the current
  resolution for you". The maximum, and also the base used for calculating the
  current resolution, is your desktop resolution. The base rule is that the
  wrapper always calculates the maximum available resolution for the given
  scaling mode, but
</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>you can restrict the base maximum to <font color = "#FFFFFF">FullHD (1920x1080) or QHD (2560x1440)</font>
        for weaker GPUs (like low-end cards or maybe, integrated chips) with large-res display outputs, and</p></li>
    <li><p>you can restrict the scale factor to integer numbers.<br>
        <font color = "#FFFFFF">(ISF - integer scale factor)</font></p></li>
</ul>

  So, dynamic resolutions are the following:
<ul>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Max:</font>           Maximum resolution available</li>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Max ISF:</font>       Maximum resolution with integer scale factor available</li>
    <li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Max FHD:</font>       Maximum resolution available
                      (but restricted to 1920x1080)</li>
  <li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Max FHD ISF:</font>     Maximum resolution with integer scale factor available
                      (but restricted to 1920x1080)</li>
  <li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Max QHD:</font>         Maximum resolution available
                      (but restricted to 2560x1440)</li>
  <li><font color = "#FFFFFF">Max QHD ISF:</font>     Maximum resolution with integer scale factor available
                      (but restricted to 2560x1440)</li>
</ul>
<p>
By default, dynamic resolutions don't have refresh rate even if enumerating refresh rates is enabled.
When working with a dynamic resolution, then the refresh rate is undefined and it is up to the wrapper and the
video card that what rate will be used (probably the one at which desktop is driven).
</p>

<li>
  <font color = "#FFFFFF">Custom resolutions</font>
  <p>
  A custom resolution is either a static one that is not in the enumerated list, or one that is partially overridden.
  Defining a custom resolution is about typing the string -manually into the combo box- describing the resolution/refresh rate pair.<br>
  Resolution and refresh rate can be overridden independently on each other. Here are some examples (don't type quotation marks):
  <ul>
    <li>"128x128, 60" - means static resolution 128x128 at forced rate of 60Hz</li>
    <li>"128x128, 0" or just "128x128" - means static resolution 128x128 without overridden refresh rate</li>
    <li>"0x0, 75" or "unforced, 75" - means unforced (static) resolution with forced 75Hz</li>
    <li>"max isf, 83" - means Max ISF dynamic resolution with forced 83Hz</li>
  </ul><br>
  If your resolution and refresh rate is in the list then it is better to select it from there than typing it manually.
  It is because e.g. 60Hz is not exactly 60Hz in practice but 60.01Hz or 59.95Hz or so, depending on your display hardware.
  dgVoodoo always handles the refresh rates in their exact rational form but it cannot do that with manually typed ones.<br>
  When displaying a refresh rate in the combo box, dgVoodoo truncates the value. So, for example, 59.95Hz will appear as 59Hz
  in the list, while the display manufacturer probably claims that your display supports 60Hz. Don't let it mislead you. It is all
  about truncating or rounding the values.
  </p>
</li>

</ul>

If you are terribly interested in how the current dynamic resolution is calculated then
a little technical part comes here. Otherwise you can skip this section.

Remarks:
<ul>
    <li><p>
        Resolution is calculated in the same way for scaling mode 'Unspecified', 'Centered' and 'Stretch with AR'.<br>
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Stretched scaling mode with ISF tries to stretch to min([D|F|Q]) and the
        scale factor for both direction is the integer part of the minimum of<br>
        <font color = "#FFFFFF">min ([Dx|Fx|Qx])/Ax</font> and <font color = "#FFFFFF">min ([Dy|Fy|Qy])/Ay</font>
        (ratios of X/Y directions).
    </p></li>
</ul>
<p>
I'd like to say some words about what happens on multimonitor systems with
dynamic resolution forcing:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
        Glide: when switching from windowed mode to fullscreen then a new forced
               resolution is calculated by the wrapper, based on the native res of the
               display on which the full screen output will appear.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        DX:    It's not so flexible at all, unfortunately. Since DX impl doesn't
               support changing resolution during its working, it cannot do the same
               as Glide when switching into fullscreen. Also, since display outputs
               are enumerated to the application, resolution calculation can rely only
               on the native res of the output on which DX is initialized (so changing
               the output of a running DX emulated app from the CPL application is without avail,
               won't affect the next resolution calculation).
     </p></li>

                                often (and silently) selects the first available device which generally corresponds to the primary monitor,
                                but advanced apps allows the user to configure it through the app itself.

                                calculating (see resolution overriding) and also, the application shall continue to see the
                                corresponding device in it original state (keep in mind that it can conflict with the app).

                        these times I tried some algorhytms as part of it. It's not really a feature,
                        but the result of some former experimenting and can be funny for some scene demos.

    <li><p><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Progressive scanline order</b></font><br>
                        Default scanline order is interlaced or progressive. It is
                        up to the output display device which one to choose altough
                        it chooses progressive when it is possible, I think, so
                        that when the device is capable of displaying a given
                        resolution with a given refresh rate with progressive order.
                        Otherwise it might choose interlaced order with halved
                        physical refresh rate.
                        If this option is enabled, you can only see enumerated
                        resolutions that are displayable with progressive order.
                        However, if a custom resolution is defined then it may
                        causes the output device to use lower physical resolution
                        than the wrapper set.

    <li><p><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Enumerate refresh rates</b></font><br>
                        Enables the CPL application to enumerate refresh rates for
                        each resolution and enables the wrapper to override the
                        default refresh rate of the application.
                        <font color = "#FFFFFF">However using other than the app default can cause heavy
                        animation lagging or glitches!</font>
    </p></li>


    <li><p><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Color adjustments</b></font><br>
                        Brightness, color intensity (saturation) and contrast can be finetuned here.
                        The defaults are good in general so treat this as a
                        cool extra. (I'm using it in some cases for making colors
                        more vital to get a bit cartoon-like effect.)

    <li><p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Inherit Color Profile in full screen mode</b></font><br>
                        When this option is enabled then dgVoodoo won't change the physical
                        gamma ramp of the screen but instead it solves the color adjustments
                        just like in windowed mode and so your pre-configured color profile(s)
                        for the given monitor(s) remain(s) preserved. Color adjustments are
                        relative to the predefined color profile in that case.
                        
    </p></li>

    <li><p><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Keep window aspect ratio</b></font><br>
                        In windowed mode, when sizing the window, you can keep
                        the aspect ratio of the current resolution.
    </p></li>

    <li><p><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Capture mouse</b></font><br>
                        It's useful mainly (but not only) for multimonitor systems. If this is enabled then the mouse cursor
                        is forced into the application window to prevent accidental mis-clicks outside of it.
    </p></li>
    
    <li><p><font color = "#FFFFFF"><b>Center app window</b></font><br>
                        When a game controlling the mouse input is being run in windowed mode then
                        it's a pain to move it's window into the screen, so I thought it's a valuable option (was a request too),
                        but it can conflict with the mouse input or the app itself.

9. General tips and known issues
</u></font></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Forcing things (like resolution, antialiasing, texture filtering, etc) is
       not a healthy thing. If an application or game uses low resolution or point
       sampled textures or anything dissonant to the eye then it has reasons for
       that. It is not because the programmers were so lame but of avoiding artifacts
       that would otherwise get brought in (typical example is a bilinear filtered
       texture with colorkey based transparency). If you force anything then
       potentially get one of those artifacts. If you can live with it then it is ok,
       use the wrapper in forced mode. If not then disable all forcings and use the
       particular game or application in the mode it was designed for, because no
       general method exists to fix such type of artifacts.</li>

    <li>Controlling antialiasing cannot be done on per-primitive basis in Direct3D 11
       when feature set larger than 10.0 is used. That is why antialiased drawing
       is not emulated in Glide automatically in this version in any way (per-primitive or
       per-edge). It can only be forced globally in the CPL application.</li>

    <li>Fullscreen gamma ramp may not be supported by your card. nVidia and ATI seem
        to handle it as expected but (e.g.) Intel does not.</li>

    <li>When an application is being run in compatibility mode (Win98/XP etc) then
       <font color = "#FFFFFF">the user's application data folder is different than the OS default.</font>
       Therefore dgVoodoo cannot read the global config file and the default
       config gets applied if no local config file is present. The preferred way
       is creating a local config for such cases if other than the default needed.
       (Perhaps using the user's appdata folder is not a too good idea after all,
       I might change it later.)</li>

    <li>If you have a multimonitor system then always try a game to run on the primary
        one for the first time. Some games lock the mouse cursor to the screen area
        where game window is assumed to be (the left-top corner of the desktop).
        If such a game is being forced onto another monitor then clicking in the game
        causes application focus loss because its window is not under the mouse cursor.</li>

    <li>I don't know why but overriding refresh rates by arbitrary values (in the resolution selector combo box) does not
        seem to work for DirectX emulation. It is still subject to investigation because the code
        handling this is common for both Glide and DirectX. :(

            <li>Introducing 'unspecified' scaling mode. If you want to apply
                'scaling but keeping aspect ratio' then select it on your graphics driver
                control panel and select 'unspecified' mode in dgVoodoo Setup.
                If it does not work then your only chance is forcing it through the
                graphics control panel (it all seems to be a Windows issue).</li>
            <li>Disabling 'Bilinear blit stretch' in the default configuration.
                I've seen a few games where it caused more 'harm' than coolness that is

                    blitting to/from textures, Z-buffers and 3D-renderable surfaces with
                    several pixel formats. Also, general API-behavioring is more accurate
                    to the original one because of lot of bugfixings and heavy reverse
                    engineering.</li>
                <li>Gammacontrol interfaces is added to DirectDraw</li>
                <li>First version of Direct3D implementation is added and (almost) fully
                    supports DirectX5, DirectX6 and DirectX7. For more and technical details,
                    see the DirectX readme. Direct3D interfaces are also as carefully reverse

                    or higher)</li>
                <li>Bug with tripebuffering fixed (missing 3D elements in The Tainted)</li>
                <li>Adapting Glide3 to 3Dfx mini GL driver (3Dfxvgl.dll),
                    (American McGee's Alice):</li>
                <li>Lowering gamma bitnum to 8 (3Dfx didn't follow his own rules...)</li>
                <li>Some init/exit code could get stuck because they can get called from
                    DLLMain, fixed</li>

            <li>Glide lib is made thread-safe at the needed (minimal) level
               (means avoiding crashes at certain circumstances where the original
               3Dfx driver survived beause of its architecture; a Turok 2 issue again,

                renderer could be added easily</li>
            <li>Fixed some issues with multiple video cards/monitors. Now it works OK
                in a multi-videocard system (not so frequent usecase but I like if
                something is done well)</li>

                paletted ones</li>
            <li>Bad color order for delta0 color, fixed
                (seems I'm not in luck with RGBA order in general)</li>

                to the aux buffer, bogus Glide3 viewport handling</li>
            <li>More optimization in LFB lock handling to avoid slowdowns on locking
                patterns/usage like in King's Quest: Mask of Eternity
                (Thanks for the feedback & help, Andrew!!)</li>

                for more)</li>
            <li>Optimizations for lfb read/write region (including 3Dfx watermark)</li>

                shader modifications</li>
            <li>Support for splash screen and shameless plug: dgVoodoo needs the 3Dfx
                splash dlls to get it working (3DfxSpl2.dll, 3DfxSpl3.dll, all with
                version 1.0.0.4), however I did not include them in the core dgVoodoo

                state are fixed</li>
            <li>Voodoo2 with 1 TMU is no longer selectable in the setup; A Voodoo2
                always have 2 TMUs and it is the default now because shaders are

                into infinite loop at a certain point)</li>
